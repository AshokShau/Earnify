## üìù Note

This repository, **Earnify**, was born out of pure boredom and a sprinkle of curiosity. While it serves its purpose as a functional bot to manage earnings and more, future updates are highly dependent on my mood. üò¥ 

That means updates might roll out when inspiration strikes‚Äîor maybe not at all. It‚Äôs a bit like a gamble, but hey, isn‚Äôt life the same? üé≤

Feel free to fork, contribute, or just enjoy it as-is. Happy earning! üí∏
